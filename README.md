## XG-Boost
XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a popular open-source machine learning algorithm designed for building efficient and scalable tree-based models.

## How XGBoost works
XGBoost works by iteratively training decision trees on the residuals of the previous trees, and then combining the results to make a final prediction. This process is repeated until the model achieves the desired level of accuracy or until a specified number of trees is reached.

### Key strengths of XGBoost
- Can handle missing data and outliers.
- Has built-in regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
- Achieves high accuracy and is relatively easy to use.


XGBoost has become a popular tool in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and online advertising. It is widely used in Kaggle competitions and other machine learning competitions due to its ability to produce accurate predictions quickly and efficiently.
